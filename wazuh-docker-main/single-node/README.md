# Deploy Wazuh Docker in single node configuration

This deployment is defined in the `docker-compose.yml` file with one Wazuh manager containers, one Wazuh indexer containers, and one Wazuh dashboard container. It can be deployed by following these steps: 

1) Increase max_map_count on your host (Linux). This command must be run with root permissions:
```
$ sysctl -w vm.max_map_count=262144
```
2) Generate the certificates using the provided image. Add the `HTTP_PROXY`
   variable to `generate-indexer-certs.yml` if your environment requires a
   proxy and run the following command:
```
$ docker compose -f generate-indexer-certs.yml run --rm generator
```
3) Start the environment with docker compose:

- In the foregroud:
```
$ docker compose up
```
- In the background:
```
$ docker compose up -d
```

The environment takes about 1 minute to get up (depending on your Docker host) for the first time since Wazuh Indexer must be started for the first time and the indexes and index patterns must be generated.
